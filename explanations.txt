# Introduction (2-3 minutes)
This section introduces the purpose of the presentation:
- The goal is to simulate and understand the inner workings of a bank web application.
- The presentation is structured as a step-by-step guide, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced topics.
- The website mimics a modern bank application with interactive examples.

# Programming Languages (3-4 minutes)
- Bank web applications are built using:
  - **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for creating user interfaces.
  - **Backend**: Java or Python for handling server-side logic and database interactions.
- **Why these languages?**
  - JavaScript is versatile and widely used for frontend development.
  - Java and Python are robust, scalable, and have strong community support.
- Example: A simple login form created using HTML, styled with CSS, and validated with JavaScript.

# Frontend Frameworks (3-4 minutes)
- Frameworks like React or Angular are used to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Why use frameworks?**
  - They simplify development by providing reusable components.
  - They enable real-time updates and interactivity.
- Example: A login form that validates user input in real-time and redirects to the next page upon submission.

# Backend Frameworks (3-4 minutes)
- Frameworks like Spring Boot (Java) or Django (Python) handle business logic, database interactions, and server-side operations.
- **Why use backend frameworks?**
  - They provide tools for routing, authentication, and database management.
  - They ensure scalability and maintainability.
- Example: A form to simulate fetching account details based on an account number.

# Databases (3-4 minutes)
- Relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL are used to securely store user and transaction data.
- **Why relational databases?**
  - They provide structured storage and support for complex queries.
  - They ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Example: A table displaying sample transaction history, including dates, descriptions, amounts, and balances.

# Security Measures (4-5 minutes)
- Security is critical in banking applications to protect sensitive user data.
- Key measures include:
  - **Encryption**: Protects data during transmission using protocols like TLS.
  - **Password Hashing**: Prevents unauthorized access by storing hashed passwords.
  - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security.
  - **Regular Audits**: Identifies and fixes vulnerabilities.
- Example: A security overview page explaining these measures in detail.

# Server Management (4-5 minutes)
- Servers are managed to ensure high availability, reliability, and security.
- Key practices include:
  - **Cloud Hosting**: Platforms like AWS or Azure provide scalability and reliability.
  - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers to prevent downtime.
  - **Monitoring Tools**: Tools like Prometheus and Grafana detect and resolve issues proactively.
  - **Backups**: Regular backups ensure data recovery in case of failures.
- Example: A description of how server management ensures smooth operation.

# Simulated Features (4-5 minutes)
- The website includes interactive examples to simulate real bank application features:
  - **Login Form**: A form that mimics user authentication.
  - **Account Details**: A page that displays user account information.
  - **Transaction History**: A table showing sample transactions.
  - **Security Page**: An overview of security measures implemented in banking applications.

# Conclusion (2-3 minutes)
- Summarize the key points covered in the presentation:
  - Bank web applications are complex systems requiring robust technologies and strong security measures.
  - The presentation demonstrated the technologies and processes behind these applications.
- Highlight the importance of careful planning and implementation in building secure and reliable banking systems.
